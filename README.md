## Make Change Project

### Week One homework for Skill Distillery

#### Overview
For my cash register, I decided to go with a couple of while loops in the main that will call a method if change is needed. 

Within the first while loop in the main, it is determined whether change needs to be computed. If so, it will execute the needed formulas to change the two variables data types, then a method is called and this information is run through a few if statements. The change is passed through each and every if statement calculating how many of each bill and each coin is needed. It will print the computed information to the user. This ends the method and a break in the program will end the program. 

If the tendered amount did not meet the criteria of the first while condition, it will then run through an if statement computing whether the amount tendered is less than the price of the product. If it is, an error message will print to the user and end the program. 

If information provided did not meet both the criteria before it, it will then run through another while loop and it will decided whether the tendered amount is the exact amount of the price of the product. If so, a message will print to the user letting them know and the program will end.

#### Lessons Learned
I learned that failure is so vital to the success of a great program. The only way to fix a program is to run it and see what it spits out. I also learned how important it is to have all the variables that you're working with are of the same type or it can really effect the outcome of your program.
